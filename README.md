# Advanced Scientific Python Programming

This project focuses on pre-processing, cleaning, and analyzing machine sounds. The goal is to use data from a lawnmower or another machine, depending on the available data.

## Project Goals
- Process machine sound data.
- Clean and filter noise from audio recordings.
- Extract important features for further analysis.

## Methods & Tools
- **Audio Processing:** Noise reduction, filtering, and Fourier Transform.
- **Feature Extraction:** Spectrograms, MFCCs, and statistical analysis.

Some of the methods and tools provided in the course "Advanced Scientific Python Programming" will be used to implement and improve the project. The dataset will be sourced online, and the project may evolve based on available data and findings.
